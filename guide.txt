1. Parallel (orthographic) projection

    Simplicity: Extremely easy to add after isometric: you just drop or rearrange axes (screen_x = x * scale, screen_y = y * scale - z * elevation).

    Effort: Minimal. You can toggle with a key.

    Usefulness: Shows difference from isometric, makes the project feel more complete.

    Recommendation: ✅ Start here. Easiest.

2. Zoom in/out

    Simplicity: Just multiply your projection results by a “scale” factor.

    Effort: Low.

    Utility: Highly noticeable, always works, no special math.

3. Translation

    Simplicity: Adjust x_offset, y_offset variables for up/down/left/right.

    Effort: Minimal if you already have offsets.

4. Rotation

    Simplicity: Requires basic trig and a little more math, but still moderate (apply 2D rotation matrix to projected points before offset).

    Effort: Medium.

5. Other bonus (your choice)

    Suggestions:

        Color gradients (already working on it): Strongest visual bonus!

        Z-height "flatten/toggle": Reduce/increase z-intensity; easy to add.
